---

Cascading Style Sheets or CSS for short is a programming language built specifically for modifying the appearance of HTML on websites. 

### History of CSS

Introduced in 1996 as a way to make the web more friendly for every day users. CSS gave developers a way to bring more life to their websites by modifying colors, shapes, and formatting for text. Though this was possible with HTML the process of making the changes with CSS was a whole lot faster.
