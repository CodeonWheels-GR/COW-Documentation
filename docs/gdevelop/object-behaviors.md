# Object Behaviors

In GDevelop, object behaviors allow you to add predefined functionalities to objects in your game without having to write complex code. Behaviors provide a way to easily implement common interactions and movements for objects, saving you time and effort.

## Adding a Behavior to an Object

To add a behavior to an object, follow these steps:

1. Open the Scene Editor and select the object you want to add a behavior to.
2. In the Object Properties panel, locate the **Behaviors** section.
3. Click the **+ Add a behavior** button.
4. A list of available behaviors will appear. Choose the desired behavior you want to add.

## Popular Behaviors

GDevelop offers a variety of built-in behaviors that cover common game mechanics. Here are some popular behaviors you can use:

### Platform Behavior

The [Platform behavior](./platform-behavior.md) is used for creating platformer games. It provides features such as gravity, jumping, and collision handling for platforms and characters.

### Platformer Character Behavior

Similar to the Platform behavior, the [Platformer Character behavior](./platformer-character-behavior.md) is specifically designed for controlling the main character in a platformer game. It includes functionalities like walking, running, and ducking.

### Draggable Object Behavior

The [Draggable Object behavior](./dragable-object-behavior.md) allows players to interact with objects by dragging them around the screen. This behavior is useful for puzzle games or any game that involves object manipulation.

### Top Down Movement Behavior

The [Top Down Movement behavior](./top-down-movement-behavior.md) enables smooth movement in a top-down perspective. It handles movement in all directions, rotation, and collision detection.

### Physics Engine Behavior

The [Physics Engine behavior](./physics-engine-behavior.md) utilizes physics simulation to create realistic object movements and interactions. It supports gravity, collisions, forces, and joints.

## Customizing Behavior Parameters

After adding a behavior to an object, you can customize its parameters to achieve the desired behavior. Each behavior has its own set of configurable options that you can modify in the Object Properties panel.

## Conclusion

Behaviors in GDevelop provide a convenient way to add functionality to objects in your game without the need for extensive coding. They allow you to focus on the gameplay and quickly prototype ideas. Experiment with different behaviors to bring your game to life!
