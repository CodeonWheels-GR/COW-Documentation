# Pixel Art Editing

Pixel art editing is a fundamental aspect of game development, especially when it comes to creating retro-style or visually distinct games. In Gdevelop, you can easily create and modify pixel art assets within the built-in image editor. This page will guide you through the essential features and techniques of pixel art editing in Gdevelop.

## Opening the Image Editor

To start editing a pixel art asset, follow these steps:

1. Select the object or sprite you want to edit in the **Project Manager** menu.
2. Right-click on the selected object and choose **Edit Image** from the context menu.
3. The image editor will open, displaying the pixel art asset you selected.

## Tools and Features

The Gdevelop image editor provides various tools and features specifically designed for pixel art editing. Here are some of the essential ones:

### 1. Pencil Tool

The pencil tool is the primary tool for drawing pixel art. Select the pencil tool and choose the desired color from the color palette. Click and drag on the canvas to draw individual pixels.

### 2. Eraser Tool

The eraser tool allows you to remove individual pixels or areas from the canvas. Use it to correct mistakes or make modifications to your artwork.

### 3. Color Palette

The color palette provides a range of colors that you can use for your pixel art. You can choose colors from the palette and apply them using the pencil tool or fill tool.

### 4. Zoom and Pan

The image editor allows you to zoom in and out of your artwork for precise editing. You can also pan across the canvas to work on different parts of the image.

### 5. Layers

Layers enable you to organize and manage different elements of your pixel art. You can add multiple layers, each containing specific elements, and adjust their visibility and order.

## Saving and Exporting

Once you have completed editing your pixel art asset, it's important to save and export it for use in your game. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click on the **File** menu in the image editor.
2. Choose **Save** to save your changes and update the asset in your project.
3. To export the pixel art asset as an image file, select **Export** from the file menu. Choose the desired file format (e.g., PNG) and specify the destination folder.
