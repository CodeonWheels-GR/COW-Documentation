# Looping Animations

In Gdevelop, animations are sequences of frames that create the illusion of motion. By default, animations play once and then stop. However, you can create looping animations that repeat continuously.

To create a looping animation in Gdevelop, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Animation Editor** for the object you want to create the looping animation for.
2. Add frames to the animation by importing images or drawing them directly in the editor.
3. Once you have added frames, select the **Loop** option for the animation in the animation list.
4. Set the desired frame duration for each frame. This determines how long each frame will be displayed before moving to the next frame.
5. Save the animation and close the Animation Editor.

Now, when you use the looping animation in your game, it will play continuously, creating a seamless loop of frames.

Looping animations are particularly useful for creating repetitive motions, such as walking or spinning objects.

You can also control the playback of animations programmatically using events and actions in Gdevelop. For example, you can trigger an animation to start or stop based on certain conditions or player input.

By utilizing looping animations effectively, you can add dynamic and engaging visual effects to your games or interactive projects.
