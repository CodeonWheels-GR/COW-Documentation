# Extensions

GDevelop provides a wide range of extensions that enhance the capabilities of your games. Extensions are pre-built functionalities or features that you can easily integrate into your projects, saving you time and effort in coding from scratch.

Using extensions, you can add specialized behaviors, effects, actions, or conditions to your game objects. These extensions are created by the GDevelop community and can be shared and reused among developers.

To find and install extensions in GDevelop, follow these steps:

1. Open GDevelop and navigate to the [**Project Manager menu**](./introduction/project-manager-menu.md).
2. Click on the **Extensions** tab.
3. You'll see a list of available extensions categorized by different functionalities or categories.

5. Click on an extension to view its details, description, and documentation.
6. To install an extension, click on the **Install** button next to its name.

## Using Extensions in Your Project

After installing an extension, you can use its features within your game objects. Here's how you can utilize extensions:

1. Open your project in GDevelop and navigate to the [**Events Editor view**](./events-editor-view.md).
2. Select the [object](./objects/what-are-objects.md) to which you want to add the extension.
