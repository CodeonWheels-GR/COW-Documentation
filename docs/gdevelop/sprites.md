# Sprites

In GDevelop, sprites are graphical objects that can be used to represent characters, objects, or any other visual element in your game. Sprites are an essential component when it comes to creating interactive and visually appealing games.

## Adding Sprites

To add a sprite to your project, follow these steps:

1. In the **Project Manager** menu, navigate to the **Sprites** section.
2. Right-click on the **Sprites** section and choose **Add a new sprite**.
3. Select an image file from your computer or choose one from the preloaded assets.
4. Customize the properties of the sprite, such as its position, size, and initial animation frame.
5. Click on the **OK** button to add the sprite to your project.

## Animations and Frames

Sprites can have multiple animations, each consisting of several frames. Frames represent different stages or poses of the sprite's animation. To create animations for your sprite, follow these steps:

1. Select the desired sprite from the **Project Manager** menu.
2. In the **Properties** panel, click on the **Animations** tab.
3. Click on the **Add an animation** button to create a new animation.
4. Specify the name and duration of the animation.
5. Add frames to the animation by either importing image files or using frames from other animations.

## Manipulating Sprites

GDevelop provides various tools and features to manipulate sprites and make them interactive. Here are some common operations you can perform with sprites:

- **Positioning**: You can change the position of a sprite on the screen using events or actions.
- **Scaling**: Modify the size of a sprite to create effects like zooming in or out.
- **Rotating**: Rotate the sprite to give it a different orientation.
- **Flipping**: Flip the sprite horizontally or vertically.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between sprites and perform actions based on the result.

These are just a few examples of what you can do with sprites in GDevelop. Experiment with different properties and behaviors to bring your game to life!
