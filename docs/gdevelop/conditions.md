# Conditions

Conditions in Gdevelop are used to define specific requirements that must be met for certain actions or events to occur within your game. They allow you to create logic and control the flow of your game based on certain circumstances.

## Understanding Conditions

In Gdevelop, conditions are used in combination with actions to create events. Conditions act as filters that check if a particular state or situation is true or false. If a condition evaluates to true, the associated actions are executed.

Conditions can be based on a variety of factors such as player input, game state, object properties, or collision detection. Gdevelop provides a wide range of built-in conditions that you can use, and you can also create your own custom conditions using events and expressions.

## Working with Conditions

To use conditions in Gdevelop, you need to be familiar with the Events Editor. The Events Editor allows you to define events and attach conditions and actions to them. Each event consists of one or more conditions, which determine when the event should trigger, and actions, which specify what should happen when the event triggers.

Conditions can be combined using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to create complex logic. You can also nest conditions within other conditions to create hierarchical structures.

## Examples of Conditions

Here are a few examples of conditions you might encounter while working with Gdevelop:

- **Keyboard Key Pressed**: This condition checks if a specific key on the keyboard is currently being pressed.
- **Mouse Button Released**: This condition verifies if a particular mouse button has been released.
- **Collision Between Objects**: This condition detects if two objects in the game have collided with each other.
- **Variable Comparison**: This condition compares the values of two variables to check if they meet a specific condition.

## Conclusion

Understanding how to work with conditions is crucial for creating interactive and dynamic gameplay in Gdevelop. By utilizing conditions effectively, you can control when certain actions occur, create branching paths, and implement complex game mechanics.
