# Update Scene

In Gdevelop, updating a scene allows you to change its properties or behaviors during gameplay. This is useful when you want to dynamically modify the scene based on certain conditions or events.

To update a scene, you can use events and actions in the Events Editor. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the [Events Editor](./events-editor-view.md) for the scene you want to update.

2. Create a new event or choose an existing event that triggers the scene update. This can be based on conditions such as a key press, collision, or a specific game event.

3. Within the event, add the appropriate action to update the scene. Gdevelop provides a wide range of actions to choose from, allowing you to modify various aspects of the scene. For example, you can change the background, spawn or remove objects, modify object properties, or trigger specific behaviors.

4. Configure the action parameters according to your requirements. You can set different values or select options to achieve the desired scene update.

5. Test and preview the scene to see the changes in action. Make adjustments as needed until you achieve the desired result.

By using the update scene feature effectively, you can create dynamic and interactive gameplay experiences in your Gdevelop projects. Experiment with different actions and conditions to unleash the full potential of scene updates.
