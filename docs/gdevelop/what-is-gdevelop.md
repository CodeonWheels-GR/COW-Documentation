# What is Gdevelop

Gdevelop is a powerful and user-friendly game development software that allows you to create your own games without the need for programming knowledge. It provides a visual interface and a wide range of built-in features and tools to help you bring your game ideas to life.

With Gdevelop, you can create games for various platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and HTML5. It supports multiple game genres, including platformers, top-down shooters, puzzle games, and more.

## Key Features of Gdevelop

- **Visual Game Editor:** Gdevelop provides a visual editor that allows you to design and organize your game's [scenes](./scenes.md), objects, and events. It offers an intuitive interface with drag-and-drop functionality, making it easy to build your game world.

- **Event-Driven Programming:** Instead of traditional coding, Gdevelop uses an event-driven system for game logic. You can define events and [actions](./actions.md), such as "when the player presses a key, move the character," without writing code explicitly.

- **Extensible with Extensions:** Gdevelop supports [extensions](./extensions.md), which are add-ons that provide additional functionality to your games. You can integrate extensions for physics simulations, special effects, advanced behaviors, and more.

- **Asset Library:** Gdevelop includes a built-in asset library where you can manage your game's resources such as [sprites](./sprites.md), sounds, and music. You can import your own assets or choose from a collection of pre-made assets available within the software.

- **Preview and Export:** Gdevelop allows you to preview your game in real-time while you're working on it. You can test your game directly in the editor to see how it looks and plays. Once your game is ready, you can export it to various platforms and share it with others.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced game developer, Gdevelop offers a versatile and accessible platform for creating games. It empowers you to unleash your creativity and turn your ideas into interactive experiences without the need for complex coding.
