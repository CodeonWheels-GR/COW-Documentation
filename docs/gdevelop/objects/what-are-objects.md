# What are Objects

In GDevelop, objects are the fundamental building blocks of your game. They represent the various entities, characters, items, and elements that make up your game world. Understanding objects is crucial to creating interactive and engaging games.

## Types of Objects

GDevelop supports different types of objects that you can use in your games. Some common types of objects include:

### Sprites

[Sprites](./sprites.md) are visual elements that can be moved, rotated, and animated. They are often used to represent characters, items, or environmental elements in your game.

### Tiled Sprites

[Tiled Sprites](./tiled-sprites.md) are similar to sprites but are used for creating repetitive patterns or backgrounds. You can tile them horizontally or vertically to create seamless visuals.

### Text

[Text](./text.md) objects allow you to display text in your game. You can customize the font, size, color, and alignment of the text to suit your game's needs.

### Button

[Button](./button.md) objects are interactive elements that respond to player input. They can be used to create menus, user interfaces, or clickable elements within your game.

## Object Properties

Each object in GDevelop has its own set of [properties](./object-properties.md) that define its behavior, appearance, and interactions with other objects. By modifying these properties, you can customize the objects to suit your game's requirements.

## Managing Objects

GDevelop provides a robust set of tools for managing objects within your game. You can create, delete, duplicate, and modify objects using the Object Editor. Additionally, you can group objects together and apply behaviors to them to add specific functionalities.

Understanding how objects work and how to manipulate them effectively is key to building complex and interactive games in GDevelop.
