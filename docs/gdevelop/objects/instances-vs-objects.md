# Instances Vs Objects

In GDevelop, understanding the difference between instances and objects is essential for creating dynamic and interactive games. Let's explore the concept of instances and objects and how they relate to each other.

## Objects

Objects in GDevelop represent the different elements that make up your game. They can be characters, enemies, items, or any other element that you want to interact with. Objects have properties, behaviors, and events associated with them.

When you create an object, you define its characteristics and behaviors. These object templates serve as blueprints for creating instances.

## Instances

Instances are the actual occurrences or copies of objects in your game. They are created based on the object templates you define. Each instance is an independent representation of its object, with its own unique properties and states.

For example, let's say you have an object called "Enemy." You can create multiple instances of this object to have multiple enemies in your game. Each enemy instance will have its own position, health, and behavior.

Instances can be created, destroyed, and manipulated during gameplay using events and actions. They allow you to bring your game to life by giving each object a specific role and behavior.

## Relationship between Instances and Objects

Instances and objects are interconnected in GDevelop. Changes made to an object's properties or behaviors will affect all instances of that object. However, instances can have individual properties and states that differ from other instances of the same object.

For example, if you modify the speed property of an object, all instances of that object will have their speed updated. But if you change the position of a specific instance, it won't affect other instances of the same object.

Understanding how instances and objects work together is crucial for creating dynamic and interactive games in GDevelop. By utilizing the power of instances, you can create unique and engaging gameplay experiences.
