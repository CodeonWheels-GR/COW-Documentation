# Object Properties

In Gdevelop, object properties allow you to customize the behavior and appearance of your game objects. Each object type has its own set of properties that can be modified to achieve the desired functionality. This page will guide you through the process of accessing and configuring object properties in Gdevelop.

To access the object properties:

1. Open the scene editor by selecting a scene from the Project Manager menu.
2. Click on the object you want to modify. The properties panel will appear on the left side of the screen.

The properties panel provides various tabs, each containing specific settings related to the selected object. Let's explore some commonly used tabs:

## General Tab

The General tab includes fundamental properties that are applicable to most objects. Some of the common properties you can find here are:

- **Object Name**: Assign a unique name to identify the object.
- **Z-Order**: Specify the object's depth in relation to other objects. Objects with a higher value appear in front of objects with a lower value.
- **Visible**: Toggle the visibility of the object. When an object is invisible, it won't be rendered in the game.

## Position Tab

The Position tab allows you to set the initial position of the object within the scene. You can specify the X and Y coordinates to determine where the object will appear when the scene starts.

## Size Tab

The Size tab enables you to define the dimensions of the object. You can set the width and height values to determine the object's size in pixels.

## Physics Tab

If you want to apply physics simulation to the object, you can utilize the Physics tab. Here, you can configure properties such as mass, density, friction, and restitution to achieve realistic object behavior.

## Additional Tabs

Depending on the object type and enabled extensions, you may encounter additional tabs specific to certain functionalities. These tabs offer specialized properties and settings to enhance the behavior of your objects.

It's worth noting that some properties can also be modified dynamically using events and actions within the Events Editor view.

By adjusting object properties, you can fine-tune your game objects to match your desired gameplay mechanics and visual aesthetics.
