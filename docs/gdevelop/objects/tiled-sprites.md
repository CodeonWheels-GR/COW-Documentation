# Tiled Sprites

Tiled sprites in GDevelop allow you to create repeating patterns or seamless backgrounds by tiling a sprite image across an object. This is useful when you want to create large areas with a consistent texture or pattern without the need for separate objects.

To use a tiled sprite, follow these steps:

1. **Import the sprite**: First, you need to import the sprite image that you want to use as a tile. Go to the **Assets** tab in the **Project Manager** menu and click on the **Import** button to add the sprite to your project.

2. **Create a new object**: Once you have imported the sprite, go to the **Objects** tab in the **Project Manager** menu and click on the **New Object** button. Choose the **Sprite** object type.

3. **Set the tiled sprite behavior**: In the **Object Properties** panel for the newly created sprite object, click on the **Behaviors** tab. Add the **Tiled Sprite** behavior to the object.

4. **Configure the tiled sprite**: With the **Tiled Sprite** behavior selected, you can adjust various settings such as the size of the tiles, the sprite image to use, and the tiling mode. Experiment with these settings to achieve the desired effect for your tiled sprite.

5. **Place the tiled sprite in the scene**: Drag and drop the tiled sprite object from the **Objects** tab onto the scene editor. You can then adjust its position, size, and other properties using the scene editor's tools.

Now you have a tiled sprite in your scene. When you run the game, the tiled sprite will repeat the sprite image across the object's surface, creating a seamless pattern or background.
