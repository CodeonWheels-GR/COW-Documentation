# Sprite Editing

In GDevelop, sprite editing is a fundamental part of creating visual assets for your game. Sprites are the visual representations of objects that can be displayed on the screen. You can create or import sprites and modify them using the built-in sprite editor.

## Accessing the Sprite Editor

To access the sprite editor in GDevelop, follow these steps:

1. Select an object that uses a sprite in your project.
2. Open the object editor by double-clicking on the object or right-clicking and selecting "Edit Object."
3. In the object editor, click on the sprite icon next to the sprite's name.

## Editing Sprites

Once you're in the sprite editor, you have various options to edit and modify your sprites. Here are some of the common editing features:

### Drawing Tools

The sprite editor provides a set of drawing tools that allow you to create and modify the pixels of the sprite. You can use tools like pencil, brush, eraser, shapes, and gradients to create your desired artwork.

### Image Import

If you have pre-existing images or artwork, you can import them into the sprite editor. GDevelop supports common image file formats such as PNG, JPEG, and GIF.

### Layers

The sprite editor utilizes layers to organize different elements of your sprite. You can have multiple layers for the sprite, each with its own set of pixels and properties. Layers allow you to work on different parts of the sprite separately and manage their visibility and order.

### Animation Frames

Sprites in GDevelop can have multiple animation frames, enabling you to create animated sequences. You can add, remove, and reorder frames to create smooth animations. Each frame represents a different state of the sprite.

### Transparency

You can make parts of your sprite transparent by using the transparency feature. This allows you to create sprites with irregular shapes or remove unnecessary backgrounds.

### Sprite Preview

The sprite editor provides a preview of how your sprite will look in different sizes and animations. You can preview the sprite's animation sequence and adjust its properties accordingly.

## Saving and Exporting Sprites

Once you're satisfied with the changes made to your sprite, you can save and export it for use in your game. The sprite editor provides options to save the sprite within your project or export it as an image file for use in other projects or external applications.

Remember to save your project regularly to preserve your sprite edits and changes.

That's it for sprite editing in GDevelop! Experiment with the different tools and features available in the sprite editor to create unique and engaging visuals for your game.
