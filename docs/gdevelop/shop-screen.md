## Navigating the Shop Screen

Once you are on the Shop Screen, you will find various categories and filters to help you find the specific items you need for your project. Here's a quick overview of the main components you'll encounter:

### 1. Categories

The Shop Screen organizes its content into different categories to streamline the browsing experience. Common categories may include:

- Graphics
- Sound Effects
- Music
- Extensions
- Templates

You can select a category of interest to narrow down your search for assets within that specific domain.

### 2. Filters

Within each category, you'll find additional filters to refine your search. These filters may include criteria such as:

- Price range
- Popularity
- Release date
- Ratings

By applying filters, you can quickly find assets that meet your specific requirements.

### 3. Item Previews

When browsing through the available items, you will typically see previews of each asset. These previews may include images, audio samples, or code snippets to give you a glimpse of what you'll get.

### 4. Item Details

Clicking on an item's preview will take you to its detailed information page. Here, you can find additional information about the asset, such as its description, author, licensing terms, and user reviews. If you decide to acquire the asset, you can initiate the download or purchase process from this page.

## Acquiring Assets

Depending on the nature of the asset, there are different ways to acquire it:

1. **Free Assets**: Some items in the Shop Screen are available for free. You can download these directly to your project by following the provided instructions.

2. **Paid Assets**: Certain assets may require a purchase before you can use them in your projects. In such cases, you will be guided through the payment process, and once completed, you can download the asset to incorporate it into your game.

3. **Extensions**: Extensions are powerful plugins that expand the functionality of Gdevelop. They are typically created by the community and may have their own installation and usage instructions. Be sure to follow the specific guidelines provided by the extension's author.

Remember to review the licensing terms of any assets you acquire to ensure compliance with the respective usage agreements.

The Shop Screen is a valuable resource for adding high-quality content to your games without having to create everything from scratch. Explore the available assets and find the perfect additions to make your games shine!
