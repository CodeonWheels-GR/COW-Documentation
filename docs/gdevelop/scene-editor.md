# Scene Editor View

In GDevelop, the Scene Editor View allows you to design and manage your game scenes. Scenes are like levels or screens in your game where you can place objects, define their behaviors, and create events to bring your game to life.

## Navigating the Scene Editor

When you open the Scene Editor View, you'll see a canvas representing your scene where you can place objects. Here are some important features and tools available in the Scene Editor:

- **Toolbar:** Located at the top of the Scene Editor, the toolbar provides quick access to common actions, such as adding objects, modifying their properties, and managing layers.
- **Object List:** On the left side of the Scene Editor, you'll find the Object List panel, which displays all the objects available in your game. You can drag and drop objects from this panel onto the canvas to add them to the scene.
- **Layers:** The Layers panel allows you to organize objects into different layers. This helps you control the order in which objects appear and interact with each other.
- **Properties Panel:** When you select an object on the canvas, the Properties panel on the right side of the Scene Editor displays its properties. You can modify various aspects of the selected object, such as its position, size, and behaviors.
- **Scene Explorer:** Located at the bottom of the Scene Editor, the Scene Explorer provides a hierarchical view of all the objects present in the scene. You can use it to navigate through the objects and their nested structures.

## Working with Objects

In the Scene Editor View, you can add various types of objects to your scene, including sprites, tiled sprites, text, buttons, and more. Each object has its own properties and behaviors that you can customize to achieve the desired functionality.

To add an object to the scene, simply drag it from the Object List onto the canvas. Once placed, you can use the mouse to resize and position the object as needed. Additionally, you can use the [Properties](./object-properties.md) panel to tweak the object's appearance, behavior, and other attributes.

## Configuring Scene Properties

Apart from managing objects, the Scene Editor also allows you to configure scene-specific properties. These properties include the scene's dimensions, background color, camera settings, and more. You can access the Scene Properties dialog by clicking on the "Scene" tab in the toolbar.

## Saving and Loading Scenes

GDevelop provides options to save and load scenes within your project. You can save your current scene to preserve your progress and load existing scenes to continue working on them. The project manager menu, which we'll cover in another section, offers easy access to these save and load functionalities.

That's a brief overview of the Scene Editor View in GDevelop. With this powerful tool, you can design and build interactive game scenes to create captivating gameplay experiences.
