# Scenes

In GDevelop, scenes are the building blocks of your game. A scene represents a specific level, menu, or any other distinct section of your game. Each scene can contain multiple objects, events, and layers that work together to create the gameplay experience.

## Adding a New Scene

To add a new scene to your project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Project Manager menu by clicking on the folder icon in the toolbar.
2. Click on the "+" button next to the "Scenes" section.
3. Enter a name for your scene and click "OK."

## Scene Editor View

Once you've created a scene, you can open it in the [Scene Editor](./scene-editor.md) view. This is where you'll design and customize the layout, add objects, set up events, and define the behavior of your game elements.

In the Scene Editor view, you'll find various tools and options that allow you to:

- **Add Objects:** You can add objects such as sprites, text, buttons, and more to your scene.
- **Manage Layers:** Layers help you organize and control the rendering order of objects in the scene.
- **Set Scene Properties:** You can define properties like the background color, camera settings, and more.
- **Add Events:** Events are used to add interactivity and logic to your game. They define how objects behave and respond to player input.

## Switching Between Scenes

During gameplay, you'll often need to switch between different scenes. This can be done using events or [actions](./actions.md) in GDevelop. For example, you can use an event to transition from the main menu scene to the gameplay scene when the player clicks the "Play" button.

To switch between scenes, you can use the "Change the scene" action in GDevelop. This action allows you to specify the target scene and define additional options such as whether to load the scene immediately or after a delay.

## Conclusion

Scenes are a fundamental concept in GDevelop that enable you to organize and structure your game. By creating multiple scenes and linking them together through events, you can build a complex and engaging gameplay experience for your players.
