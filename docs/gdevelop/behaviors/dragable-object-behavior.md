# Draggable Object Behavior

The Draggable Object Behavior in GDevelop allows you to make objects draggable by the player or user. This behavior is commonly used in interactive games or applications where objects need to be moved or rearranged by dragging them with the mouse or touch input.

To add the Draggable Object Behavior to an object in your project, follow these steps:

1. Select the object in the Scene Editor.
2. In the Object Properties panel, click on the "Add a new behavior" button.
3. Search for "Draggable Object" in the behavior search bar and select it.
4. Adjust the behavior's settings according to your needs, such as defining the drag axis, enabling or disabling rotation, or setting the drag threshold.

Once you have added the Draggable Object Behavior to an object, you can customize its behavior further by using events in the Events Editor. For example, you can create conditions and actions to specify what happens when the object is dragged, released, or dropped on specific targets.

## Dragging Restrictions

You can apply restrictions to the dragging behavior to control where and how the object can be dragged. Some of the common restrictions include:

- **Drag Axis**: You can limit dragging to a specific axis (horizontal, vertical, or both) by selecting the appropriate option in the behavior settings.
- **Draggable Area**: You can define a specific area within which the object can be dragged. This is useful when you want to confine the object's movement to a particular region of the screen.
- **Collisions**: You can prevent the object from being dragged through obstacles or other objects by checking for collisions during the drag and applying appropriate actions.

By combining the Draggable Object Behavior with other behaviors and events, you can create various interactive and dynamic features in your game or application.

Remember to test and iterate your game to make sure the draggable objects behave as intended.

That's it for the Draggable Object Behavior! With this behavior, you can add interactive dragging functionality to your objects and enhance the interactivity of your game or application.
