# Physics Engine Behavior

The Physics Engine behavior in GDevelop allows you to apply realistic physics simulations to your objects. By enabling this behavior, you can add gravity, forces, and collisions to your objects, creating a more interactive and dynamic game environment.

## Enabling the Physics Engine Behavior

To enable the Physics Engine behavior for an object, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Scene Editor](../scene-editor.md) view.
2. Select the object to which you want to add the Physics Engine behavior.
3. In the [Object Properties](../objects/object-properties.md) panel, click on the "Add a behavior" button.
4. In the behaviors list, locate and select the "Physics Engine" behavior.
5. Adjust the behavior's settings according to your requirements.

## Physics Engine Properties

The Physics Engine behavior provides several properties that allow you to customize the physics simulation. Here are some of the commonly used properties:

- **Gravity**: Determines the strength and direction of the gravitational force applied to the object.
- **Mass**: Defines the mass of the object, which affects its response to forces and collisions.
- **Friction**: Specifies the amount of friction that acts upon the object during movement.
- **Bounciness**: Determines the bounciness of the object, controlling how it reacts when colliding with other objects.
- **Linear Damping**: Sets the rate at which the object's linear velocity decreases over time.
- **Angular Damping**: Controls the rate at which the object's angular velocity decreases over time.

## Events and Actions

The Physics Engine behavior also provides a set of events and actions that allow you to interact with the physics simulation. Some of the available events include collision detection, contact callbacks, and proximity checks. Actions can be used to apply forces, set velocities, and manipulate the physics properties of the object.

## Examples

To help you get started with the Physics Engine behavior, here are a few examples of how you can use it:

- Create a platformer game where the player character can jump, fall, and collide with obstacles using realistic physics.
- Simulate a physics-based puzzle game where objects interact with each other based on their physical properties.
- Develop a racing game where cars are subject to gravity, friction, and collisions with the environment and other vehicles.

Experiment with the Physics Engine behavior and explore its various settings and capabilities to bring your game ideas to life!
