# Platformer Character Behavior

The Platformer Character Behavior is a powerful feature in Gdevelop that allows you to easily create platformer-style movement for your game characters. This behavior provides a set of actions and conditions specifically designed for platformer mechanics.

To add the Platformer Character Behavior to an object in your scene, follow these steps:

1. Select the object you want to add the behavior to in the **Scene Editor View**.
2. In the **Object Properties** panel, click on the **Add a new behavior** button.
3. Search for "Platformer Character" in the behavior search bar and select it from the results.
4. Customize the behavior's parameters according to your needs. You can modify settings such as gravity, jump force, maximum speed, and more.

Once you've added the Platformer Character Behavior to an object, you can use the associated conditions and actions to control the movement and interactions of the object in your game.

## Conditions

Here are some commonly used conditions provided by the Platformer Character Behavior:

- `Is on floor`: Checks if the character is standing on a platform or the ground.
- `Is jumping`: Checks if the character is currently in a jumping state.
- `Is falling`: Checks if the character is currently falling through the air.
- `Is moving`: Checks if the character is currently moving horizontally.

## Actions

Here are some commonly used actions provided by the Platformer Character Behavior:

- `Set acceleration`: Sets the acceleration value for the character's movement.
- `Set deceleration`: Sets the deceleration value for the character's movement.
- `Set maximum speed`: Sets the maximum speed at which the character can move.
- `Jump`: Makes the character perform a jump.

The Platformer Character Behavior is a versatile tool that simplifies the implementation of platformer mechanics in your game. Experiment with different settings and combinations of conditions and actions to achieve the desired gameplay experience.
