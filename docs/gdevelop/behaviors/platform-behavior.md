# Platform Behavior

The Platform Behavior in GDevelop allows you to create objects that can move and interact with the platform-like physics. It's a powerful feature that simplifies the creation of platformer games.

## Enabling the Platform Behavior

To enable the Platform Behavior for an object, follow these steps:

1. Select the object in the Scene Editor.
2. In the Object Properties panel, click on the "Behaviors" tab.
3. Click the "+" button to add a new behavior.
4. Search for "Platform" and select the "Platform Behavior" from the list.
5. Customize the behavior's properties according to your needs.

## Properties of the Platform Behavior

Once the Platform Behavior is added to an object, you can configure its properties. Here are some of the essential properties:

- **Max Speed**: Sets the maximum speed at which the object can move horizontally or vertically.
- **Acceleration**: Controls how quickly the object reaches its maximum speed.
- **Deceleration**: Determines how quickly the object slows down when not actively moving.
- **Jump Speed**: Defines the initial velocity when the object jumps.
- **Gravity**: Specifies the gravitational force affecting the object.
- **Can Grab Platform**: Allows the object to grab and hold onto platforms.
- **Jumpthru**: Specifies whether the object can jump through platforms from below.

## Controlling the Platform Behavior

The Platform Behavior provides several actions and conditions that allow you to control and interact with the object during gameplay. Some of the commonly used actions and conditions include:

- **Move**: Moves the object horizontally or vertically.
- **Jump**: Makes the object perform a jump.
- **Simulate Control**: Simulates the control of the object, such as pressing left, right, or jump keys.
- **Is Moving**: Checks if the object is currently moving.
- **Is On Floor**: Checks if the object is standing on a platform.
- **Is Jumping**: Checks if the object is currently jumping.

## Tips and Tricks

- Use the **Platform Behavior** in combination with other behaviors, such as **[Platformer Character Behavior](./platformer-character-behavior.md)**, to create complex platformer mechanics.
- Experiment with different values for properties like **Acceleration**, **Deceleration**, and **Jump Speed** to achieve the desired movement feel.
- Combine the **Platform Behavior** with events and conditions to create interactive platformer elements, such as moving platforms or springs.

With the **Platform Behavior**, you can quickly implement platformer mechanics in your game without having to deal with complex physics calculations. It's a versatile tool that can bring your platformer games to life.

Now that you have an understanding of the Platform Behavior, you can start adding platformer elements to your game and create exciting levels with ease.
