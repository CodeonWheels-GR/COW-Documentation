# Gdevelop Interface

The Gdevelop interface provides you with various tools and features to create your games. Familiarizing yourself with the interface is essential to make the most out of Gdevelop's capabilities. Let's explore the different elements of the Gdevelop interface:

1. **Menu Bar**: The menu bar at the top of the window contains options for file management, project settings, and more. You can access various functionalities such as opening projects, saving, exporting, and publishing your games.

2. **Project Manager**: The project manager is located on the left side of the interface. It allows you to manage your projects, create new ones, open existing projects, and organize project resources such as scenes, objects, and events.

3. **Scene Editor**: The [scene editor](../scene-editor.md) is where you design and build your game levels or screens. It provides a visual interface where you can place objects, add backgrounds, set up collision properties, and define the layout of your game.

4. **Events Editor**: The [events editor](../events-editor-view.md) is where you create the logic and interactions for your game. It uses a visual scripting system based on events, [conditions](../conditions/what-are-conditions.md), and [actions](../actions/what-are-actions.md). You can define what happens when specific events occur, such as [collisions](../conditions/on-collision.md), button presses, or the [start of a scene](../conditions/at-beginning-of-scene.md).

5. **Properties Panel**: The [properties](../objects/object-properties.md) panel displays the properties and settings of the selected objects or elements. You can use it to modify object behaviors, appearance, positions, and other parameters.

6. **Resources Panel**: The resources panel provides an overview of all the project resources, such as images, sounds, fonts, and external files. You can import and manage your game assets from this panel.

7. **Preview and Play**: Gdevelop allows you to preview your game in real-time within the editor. You can test and play your game to see how it behaves before exporting or publishing it.

Take your time to explore each section of the Gdevelop interface. Understanding how to navigate and utilize these elements will enable you to create engaging and interactive games effectively.
