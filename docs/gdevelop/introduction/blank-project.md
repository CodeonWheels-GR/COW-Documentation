# Starting a Blank Project

To start a blank project in Gdevelop, follow these steps:

1. Launch Gdevelop.
2. On the home screen, click on the "Create a new project" button.
3. In the project creation dialog, select the "Blank project" option.
4. Choose a name and location for your project.
5. Click on the "Create" button.

Once you've created a blank project, you'll be taken to the [Build screen](../screens/build-screen.md) where you can start building your game from scratch. Gdevelop provides a wide range of tools and features to help you develop your game quickly and easily.

You can also customize various project settings such as screen size, orientation, and other options from the [Project Manager menu](./project-manager-menu.md).

Start by adding scenes to your project and designing them using the [Scene Editor](../scene-editor.md) view. Then, use the [Events Editor view](../events-editor-view.md) to define the game's logic and behaviors.

Gdevelop allows you to create games without any coding knowledge using its visual scripting system. With a wide variety of pre-built behaviors and events, you can create complex interactions and gameplay mechanics effortlessly.

Happy game development with Gdevelop!
