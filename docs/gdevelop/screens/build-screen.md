# Build Screen

The Build Screen in Gdevelop allows you to compile your game for different platforms and export it as an application or web game. Here, you can customize various settings related to your game's build, such as target platform, resolution, and packaging options.

To access the Build Screen, follow these steps:

1. Open Gdevelop.
2. Click on the "Build" tab located at the top of the interface.

From the Build Screen, you can choose the target platform for your game, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, or HTML5. Additionally, you can configure specific options for each platform, such as screen orientation, permissions, and icon design.

Once you have selected your options, click on the "Build" button to compile your game. Gdevelop will generate the necessary files and provide you with the final build that you can distribute or publish.

Make sure to test your game thoroughly on the target platform before releasing it to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.
