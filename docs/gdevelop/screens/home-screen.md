# Home Screen

When you first launch GDevelop, the home screen will be the first thing you see. It provides a central hub for accessing various features and resources within the GDevelop software. Here's an overview of what you can find on the home screen:

## Project Management

On the home screen, you can create new projects, load existing ones, and access recently opened projects. This allows you to quickly jump into your work or start a new game development endeavor.

## Tutorials and Examples

GDevelop offers a range of tutorials and example projects to help you get started or learn new techniques. The home screen provides links to these resources, allowing you to explore and leverage the knowledge shared by the GDevelop community.

## News and Updates

Stay up-to-date with the latest news and updates from the GDevelop team. The home screen displays notifications about new versions, bug fixes, feature announcements, and other important information.

## Community and Support

Connect with other GDevelop users through the community links available on the home screen. You can access the official GDevelop forum, chat with other developers on Discord, or follow GDevelop on social media platforms to stay engaged with the community.
