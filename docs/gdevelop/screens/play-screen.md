# Play Screen

The Play screen in Gdevelop allows you to test and play your game directly within the editor. It provides a real-time preview of your game's behavior and allows you to interact with the game elements.

## Running Your Game

To run your game on the Play screen, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have at least one scene created for your game. If you haven't created a scene yet, refer to the [Scenes](../scenes) page for instructions.
2. Click on the **Play** button located at the top toolbar or press **F5** on your keyboard. This will launch the game in a separate window or a preview pane within the editor itself, depending on your preferences.
3. Interact with your game using the provided controls or keyboard inputs. This allows you to test the gameplay, mechanics, and overall functionality of your game.

:::caution

The Play screen is meant for testing purposes and provides a preview of your game. It may not accurately represent the final performance or behavior of your game on different platforms or devices.

## Debugging and Error Handling

While testing your game on the Play screen, you may encounter errors or unexpected behavior. Gdevelop provides several tools to help you debug and handle such situations:

- **Console**: The Console panel, usually located at the bottom of the editor, displays runtime messages, warnings, and errors. It can be used to track down issues and identify potential problems in your game.
- **Debugger**: Gdevelop offers a powerful Debugger tool that allows you to inspect variables, step through events, and trace the flow of your game's execution. It can be accessed through the top toolbar or by pressing **F7**.

Make use of these debugging features to identify and resolve any issues that arise during gameplay testing.

## Play Screen Controls

The Play screen provides various controls to interact with your game during testing. Here are some commonly used controls:

- **Keyboard Inputs**: Depending on the events and actions you have set up in your game, you can use specific keys to trigger certain actions or movements.
- **Mouse**: The mouse can be used to interact with objects, buttons, or other elements in your game.
- **Touch Controls**: If you have implemented touch controls in your game, you can simulate touch inputs using the mouse on the Play screen.

Experiment with these controls to ensure that your game responds correctly and functions as intended.

By utilizing the Play screen effectively, you can quickly iterate and test your game, making necessary adjustments and improvements along the way.
