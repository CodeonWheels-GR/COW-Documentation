# Events Editor View

The Events Editor View in Gdevelop allows you to create and manage events that define the logic and behavior of your game. Events are triggered by specific conditions and can perform various actions.

## Opening the Events Editor View

To open the Events Editor View, follow these steps:

1. Select a scene in the Project Manager Menu.
2. Click on the "Events" tab at the top of the Scene Editor View.

## Creating Events

Events in Gdevelop consist of conditions and actions. Conditions determine when an event should be triggered, and actions specify what should happen when the event is triggered.

To create an event, perform the following steps:

1. Click on the "+" button in the Events Editor View.
2. Choose a condition from the list of available conditions.
3. Set the parameters for the selected condition.
4. Click on the "+" button next to the condition to add actions.
5. Select an action from the list of available actions.
6. Configure the parameters for the selected action.

## Organizing Events

In Gdevelop, you can organize events into groups for better management and readability. To create a group, follow these steps:

1. Right-click in the Events Editor View.
2. Select "Add group" from the context menu.
3. Enter a name for the group.

You can also nest groups within other groups to create a hierarchical structure.

## Testing Events

To test your events and see how they affect your game, you can use the Debugger in Gdevelop. The Debugger allows you to step through events, inspect variable values, and track the execution flow.

To open the Debugger, click on the "Debug" button in the top toolbar.

## Conclusion

The Events Editor View is a powerful tool in Gdevelop that enables you to create complex game logic using events, conditions, and actions. By understanding how to create and organize events, you can bring your game ideas to life and create interactive experiences for players.
