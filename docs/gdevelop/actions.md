# Actions

Actions in Gdevelop allow you to define specific behaviors or tasks that should be performed when certain conditions are met. They are an essential part of creating interactive and dynamic games.

## Adding Actions

To add actions to your game, follow these steps:

1. Open the Events Editor by clicking on the "Events" tab at the top of the screen.
2. Select the event or condition to which you want to attach actions. For example, you might choose the "On Key Press" event.
3. Right-click on the event or condition and choose "Add Action" from the context menu.
4. A dialog box will appear, presenting you with a list of available actions categorized by functionality. Choose the action that corresponds to the behavior you want to implement.

## Configuring Actions

Once you've added an action to your event or condition, you can configure its parameters to customize its behavior. The available configuration options depend on the specific action you've chosen.

To configure an action, follow these steps:

1. Select the action in the Events Editor.
2. In the properties panel on the right side of the screen, you'll find the available configuration options for the selected action. Modify these options according to your requirements.

## Examples of Actions

Here are a few examples of commonly used actions in Gdevelop:

- **Show/Hide Object**: Use this action to make an object visible or invisible on the screen.
- **Change Object Position**: This action allows you to move an object to a specific position in the scene.
- **Delete Object**: Use this action to remove an object from the scene entirely.
- **Play Sound**: This action plays a sound effect or background music in your game.
- **Change Scene**: Use this action to switch between different scenes in your game.

These are just a few examples, and Gdevelop offers a wide range of actions to suit various game development needs.

Actions form the building blocks of game logic in Gdevelop. By combining conditions and actions, you can create complex behaviors and interactions within your game.

Keep in mind, actions are executed in the order they appear in the Events Editor. Make sure to plan your events and actions accordingly.
