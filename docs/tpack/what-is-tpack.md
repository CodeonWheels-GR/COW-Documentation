## TPACK

A Framework designed to incorporate Technology into the creation of classroom materials in order to keep curriculum engaging and effective for students.

## Where TPACK originated from

Originally designed in the early 2000's by Punya Mishra & Matthew Koehler. The TPACK system was built to address the ever shifting classroom curriculums as a result of the rapid innovation in technology that was being integrated into schools. 

Matthew Koehler himself uploaded a great video covering the history of TPACK. How it came to be, how it developed, and the many hurdles it faced to be become the framework we utilize now.

## Why COW uses TPACK

Being an organization that focuses on integrating technology into the curriculum of students in a way that is both accessible and accommodating. TPACK is amazing framework that aids in the fulfillment of the standards we've established for our programs. 

Allowing for Cow to build programs that are

* Adaptable to different environments
* Accessible to students of different backgrounds
* Up to date with latest practices in the field
* Programs that are Documented from top to bottom

## How COW uses TPACK

Because of the nature of the Framework, TPACK covers most of anything you can think of when building materials for a classroom. However the process of integrating it into an organization calls for the need of slight adjustments to the model. Which puts TPACK to function as intended.

Within Code on Wheels we've modified the TPACK system into a nine phase process that ensures material from every step of the process is documented. Allowing for quicker development down the line as well as the development of a rich information library to refer to when developing programs. The aim of this ultimately being to provide instructors with the tools and resources to create the best programs possible for each context.

### Our huge change

Traditionally within the TPACK system Content Knowledge (CK) would be developed or brought in to address specific subjects or objectives traditionally outlined by the Public Education system. However, because of the nature of Code on Wheels and previous experience with Loop Coding Center. We've decided to push the process of CK development outside of the standard framework process. 

This means that the team develops CK independently from the 9 Phase Process and instead opts to build CK independently from classes and workshops and instead relies on other factors. Doing so allows for our team members to build a strong catalogue of source material to utilize and develop without the worry of a deadline. Meaning programs are built and prepared only when proper documentation on the subject matter has been built out. 

A benefit of this modification results in making the process of brining on new instructor a lot easier. As they can reference internal knowledge for any material they may be teaching the students. While also being able to contribute to the same CK based on experience in the subject.

## The 9 Phase Process

Designed around the chaotic nature of Loop Coding Center programs this 9 step process is built out to accommodate for the chaotic nature of the field while providing structure to build effective material.
