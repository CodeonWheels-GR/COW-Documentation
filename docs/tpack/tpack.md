## The full picture

Finally after applying all of this methodology we reach TPACK. A synthesis made up of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge forming what we call TPACK.

Here we have a full understanding of how each of these concepts functions independently within a program as well as how they work together. This a great thing to have because it can provide a window into what actually works, how we can improve things, and things we should eliminate from our programs.

## Documenting TPACK process

The final step of documentation isn't the documentation of a methodology or tools that were used in a class. But finally a full class or workshop with details layed out as to how the class is anticipated to run, lessons, activities, technologies, how things performed within the classroom, and how material was adjusted to changes in the class.

## Assessing TPACK Performance

After our program has been built and the class has been run we have an opportunity to review the class to receive multiple benefits.

#### Reviewing Notes

First comes the simple process of reviewing notes and providing how you generally felt about the course as an instructor. Though this isn't hard data, notes like these can provide context as to what was occurring within the classroom. This qualitative information may also be helpful to come back to in the building of another class or workshop as well.

#### Assessing Objectives

Based on Objectives that are set at the begging of the class we can measure just how many of those metrics were met in order to quantify success in a fashion that is important but not integral to the success of a program.

#### Assessing TPACK

When it comes to assessing the performance of TPACK this can be accomplished by assessing portions of the material that didn't perform as expected and identifying which of the sources that issue was drawn from. Be it PK, CK, TK or any of the combinations.
