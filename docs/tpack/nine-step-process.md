# Preface 

This 9 step process is built out to guide Program Instructors in building Classes & Workshops upon request of a partner. The process of defining programs is done on a annual basis and is worked on year round by the Programs Team. 

So to clarify, programs are not built out from scratch per request of a partner. They are pieced together with documented information as context about the partner and the conditions are discovered.

# Discovery Phase

## Client Onboarding

Without interest in the programs all the hard work we put into the building of material would be for nothing! So we've got a great sales team putting in the work to make sure we have students to teach. When we begin the building of a class or workshop the process starts with identifying organizations who will partake.

Due to the sales heavy nature of this process the best the programs team can do in this spare time is prepare. If no classes are happening during a period it becomes an opportune time for R&D. In the case of ongoing talks between the sales team and a partner some anticipated work and documentation can be completed before beginning of the discovery phase. Though it isn't a solid expectation, taking this time before the discovery phase to research the school district, the demographics of the area, (Census data is highly suggested!) and programs the school has participated in during past time. 

All of this information will ultimately assist in the mapping of program material to the potential class or workshop. Which leaves us with a lot of extra questions that are addressed in the following step.

## Objective Definition

Now that the organization has subscribed to the idea of a program facilitated by Code on Wheels. The sales team will continue the process of collecting information for the Program Team. In this step a lot of the context that is focused on within TPACK is revealed. Allowing for the team to build out a workshop or class to best fit the needs of the specific instance.

### A great source of context

Using a modular data collection form, the sales team will collect as many juicy details about the organization as possible during this onboarding phase. This data all gets directly funneled into an easy to read documentation form that provides the Program Team with a large portion of the details that will allow them to build out the programs for this instance. Expectations of the data being provided for the program should read as follows

#### Program Baselines

- Organization Name
- Program format
- Location of Program
- Program Subject
- Program Time Windows
- Classroom Technologies
- Student Age/Grade Range
- Classroom Size

### Other Information
- Classroom Setting
- Previous Student Experiences
- Inclusion or Absence of Assistance
- Student Learning Styles

# Planning Phase

## 1. CK Implementation

The first and most vital step is understanding the subject matter that will be taught in the class. This will most likely be decided on in discussions between the Sales Team and our partners. Our job as an instructor is to define the scope of material that will be taught to the students based on factors that are presented to us in the discovery phase of the project. This will help us set realistic expectations for what the students will be able to learn based on the limiting factors that we will face in the classroom.

As you plan this step out you'll find that you'll begin to creep into questions that are dependent on other steps. For example, when blocking time for lessons to estimate how long it will take to teach material. You will find yourself wondering if the lesson will go quicker or slower depending on the Technologies(TK) being used or methods for teaching the material(PK). To address this issue simply note how these CK dependent questions interact with the other areas of the TPACK model. Doing so will allow you to document problem areas that you may face, however these are issues that will most likely iron themselves out as you work through the other steps as they most likely will be addressed when synthesizing CK, TK, and PK into PCK, TCK, and TPK. 

In a way you're filling out pieces of information for the other steps before you even reach them.

For further instructions on the implementation of CK refer to the documentation ----> 

<!-- #### Program Duration

The first thing to consider when planning a class or workshop is the duration of the class. A class with 25 hours of time will be able to cover a lot more material in depth than a workshop that lasts for 3 hours. Deciding on the scope of the material can be deceptively difficult however. This is due to the fact that we can prepare exactly 25 hours of material to fit the program perfectly. But due to the nature of the any classroom these plans will most definitely derail at some point. Or in the rare chance, go quicker than expected. It's for this reason that we always pad the material for a program with a couple of extra hours of material to ensure there will always be valuable information to share with the students. In most cases an extra 2-6 hours of material for a classroom should be sufficient depending on the length of the classroom or workshop.  -->

<!-- #### Program Format

The program format determines whether or not the class will be taught through a digital or physical format. This factor will have a large effect on how time should be blocked out for a classroom as you have to consider circumstances that differ between the two methods of instruction. 

##### What to consider with Digital Classes

- Account Registration
- Remote Tooling Set Up
- Remote Issue fixing
- Remote Classroom Administration

##### What to consider with In Person Classes

- Classroom disruptions -->


<!-- #### Classroom Age/Grade

With knowledge of the students age group and their current education we can make adjustments according to assumptions we can make on their educational backgrounds. 

To understand why this is important consider trying to teach Javascript to students who don't understand the concept of the variable. In this instance it is likely that 

When planning out how long things will take it always important to consider the difficulty of the material for the students relative to their experience. Even though most documented lessons will have a estimated completion attached to them consider this is always dependent on experience of the students.  -->

## 2. TK Implementation

To continue with the building of a program we move onto the TK of the classroom. When piecing together a classroom this step will set boundaries on how material is implemented in the classroom and define what falls into the realm of possibility. To comprehend this, consider the difference in the sharing of communication in a classroom that has a whiteboard and a classroom that doesn't. Because of the limitations of the technology of our classroom we have to fall back to oral communication to share concepts with students instead of being able to visually represent them.

It's for the reason of considering factors like this that the step exists. Without consideration of how technology is implemented into the classroom we create stagnated material that can be disengaging to students and at worst, simply fail to teach anything. 

For further instructions on the implementation of TK refer to the documentation ----> 

## 3. PK Implementation

Application of Pedagogical knowledge independent of the other factors can be tricky. However the things we consider in this step will play a large role in how information is broken down and shared in a program. It's in this step that the Instructor is granted a choice on how information will be communicated within a program based on prior documentation within the system. With knowledge on factors that dictate the format of the classroom we as Instructors can select methodologies we believe will best work within a setting. And do so without the fear of failing with the highly adaptable model of TPACK.

# Synthesis Phase

## 4. PCK Development

Synthesizing of PK and CK to develop a methodology for teaching of material that best suits the classroom context. When planing out the CK and PK for the classroom it is likely that you inadvertently pieced together material that directly built pieces of this step. 

Ultimately this step will allow for us to outline the lessons that will be implemented into the classroom. Understanding how the relationship between the CK and PK works in this context we can move past simply outlining the framework. Instead moving onto fully fleshing out the lessons that will be built for the class, their many properties, their exceptions, and expectations.

For further instructions on the implementation of PCK refer to the documentation ---->

## 5. TCK Development

Synthesizing of TK and CK to develop boundaries of whats possible with the Technology and Subject matter for the classroom. 

With this step of the TPACK process we aim to define the format in which the lessons will be implemented. Utilizing the SAMR model we can adjust lessons to be taught to their best potential based on the tools being used. To illustrate this consider how much more effective teaching programming is through a fully fledged IDE than it would be through a notepad. Both technologies complete the same job in the end but one makes it a lot easier than the other.

## 6. TPK Development

Synthesizing of TK and PK to develop lessons based on the technologies that are selected for the context.

Finally we decide on the implementation of TPK which dictates how the technology that has been selected is utilized by the Instructor. This step is completely dependent on the context that is the expertise of the instructor. An tech industry professional may have a better clue as to how to navigate a certain software suite in order to showcase information to a student. In another case a Teacher may have a better clue on how to administrate a class through the use of Google Classroom than your average techie would. 

In the end the key take away for this step is documentation the problem solving your perform to ensure all tools are being used to their fullest potential.

## 7. Real Class Context

It's often that details are missing when building a class, documenting how classes differed from expectation on the first day of class is essential to catching an issues before they become to large to handle.

The building of a living document that will documents decisions made through the building of a class or workshop.

---

## 8. Classroom Instruction

Documented adjustments that are made throughout the class as a result of ill-communication in the discovery phase to accommodate for real classroom context.

---

## 9. End of Program Assessment

Assessment of the effectiveness of CK, PK, TK, PCK, TCK, and TPK through a survey provided to students at the end of a program.
