## What is TCK

In simple terms TCK is knowing how the technology being used effects the subject matter that is being taught.

As an illustrative example consider the difference between a drivers ed class that has a series of videos and packets and a drivers ed class with a driving simulator. With this difference in technology a large chunk of the material can be compressed into smaller but equally effective lessons as material can be visually represented in the simulator instead of as a blurb in a packet of material. Some material may even be cut all together due to the effectiveness of the visual storytelling the simulator provides.

## Classroom Context

In the case of TCK context comes down to what materials will be available within the classroom as well as the technologies that the students are comfortable with. For the most part this portion of TPACK will be built upon the decisions that were made with TK and CK.

For example, the context of not having a projector in a classroom will affect which technologies would be used to share lesson with the students. With a project we could simply share a screen, whereas without one we may resort to a screen sharing software or whiteboard.

## TK + CK

In the synthesis of TK & CK, TK provides tooling to most effectively implement the CK. While CK provides boundaries on what is achievable with the source material. Combined they benefit each other by simplifying and optimizing procedural tasks that would drag the class down. For example, the speed up of a set up process that may eat 10 minutes of every class which is optimized with a laptop Macro. Or even simpler, a tool that allows the teacher to to assist students with Bug fixes in real time.

## Applying the SAMR Model

A great tool for identifying if using technology to teach material is beneficial or detrimental.
