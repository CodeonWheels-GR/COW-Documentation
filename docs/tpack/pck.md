## What is PCK

In simple terms PCK is the know how on teaching a specific subject.

For example someone who specializes in Python would be able to implement more effective PCK into their Python class due to their deeper understanding of concepts that relate to subject matter. As well as having an advantage of experience with communicating the terms relevant to the subject in more professional environments.

Within the context of Code on Wheels PCK provides the team a way to document tips and techniques that can be brought by various professionals in the field. Overtime this will lead to a rich library of resources that can be utilized by team members looking to improve a class or workshop they are developing.

## Classroom Context

When contemplating classroom context and PCK it is important to understand the students backgrounds foremost.

In the same way that age and grade effect the degree of material that can be taught to the students. The educational background of the students can provide many indicators as to whether the students would be more receptive to certain technical terms. In some cases this may effect things such as knowledge of grammar related keys which would result in the need to communicate the location of keys such as the apostrophe or semi-colon. Or in some cases even technical keys such as **esc** and **shift**.

## PK + CK

In the synthesis of PK and CK, PK brings a way to teach materials in a manner that is impactful to students. While CK contributes the fundamentals that students should be learning for the subject matter.
Combined they benefit in influencing each other by raising the question of what methods are actually the most effective for teaching certain subject matters. To best illustrate this, consider the laissez faire approach to a large collection of technical documentation on the web. Unless you've found specific material on how to build a specific project you are most likely digging through documentation and maybe even stack overflow to learn new materials. Though this may encourage the autonomous learning we seek in our students it simply is a barrier for entry and pushes many individuals away from the subject matter.

Ultimately with the synthesis of PK and CK the goal is to find a method to teach the fundamentals and jargon of a concept in a manner that is quick, effective, and a lot friendlier for the classroom context.
