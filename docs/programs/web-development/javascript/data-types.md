## Boolean  

Booleans are a pretty simple concept with a weird name. A Boolean can be two things, either true or false.

```js
let trueDude = true;
let falsey = false;
```

## Numbers

Just like in math in Javascript a number is a number. No special symbols or values

```js
let seven = 7;
let yellow = 80;
```

## Strings

Strings are a collection of characters placed inside of **Quotation Marks**. Single or Double quotations work

```js
let seven = 'The number 7';
let yellow = "The color of a sunflower";
```

## Arrays

An **Array* is a collection of data with indexes. Meaning everything placed inside of the array will have a number that pairs with it which tells us the position of the item.

In order to add more than one item commas should be used to tell the computer that they are separate items.

```js
let dwarves = ['Sneezy', 'Sleepy', 'Happy', 'Doc', 'Grumpy', 'Dopey', 'Bashful'];
```

:::tip Counting with Indexes

In the list above Sneezy can be found at Index[0]. Sleepy can be found at Index[1] and so on.
