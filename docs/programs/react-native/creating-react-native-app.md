---

The quickest way to create a React Native application is using Expo Go. Follow the steps below to get your React Native application up and going fast!

1) Open the terminal<br/>
2) Navigate to the directory that you wish to create your react application within. In our example it will be the desktop.
```
cd Desktop
```
3) Run `npx create-expo-app exampleName`  
- Note that exampleName is the name of the react application and can be named anything you choose

4) Navigate to the directory that you just created
```
cd exampleName
```

5) Run the react application using the command `npx expo start`
- Note the QR code that is displayed in your terminal as you will use this soon

6) Install the `Expo Go` app on your phone and create an account
- Make certain that your phone and computer are on the same wifi network

7) Scan the QR code
- Android: Use the Expo Go app 
- iOS: Use the QR code scanner on the camera app

After you do this the app will automatically install itself on your phone and you can begin developing!
