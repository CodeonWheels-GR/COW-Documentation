## WHAT IS MIT APP INVENTOR

Is a visual programming environment that allows everyone to build fully functional apps for smartphones and tablets. The students get to understand code by using Block style code. This format helps when students are brand new to coding but want to build a mobile app.

## DEPLOYMENT 

MIT App Inventor has a built-in emulator you can learn more on on the [Setup page](Setup.md) that allows to practically run the program in multiple systems. By allowing us to run the program practically anywhere, we are making it more accessible to students.

## OUR EXPERIENCE 

In 2018, we were asked by [WMCAT](https://wmcat.org/) to run a 15-week course to teach how to build mobile apps. We decided to pursue MIT App Inventor since it has been recognized as a very strong tool for any entry-level student who wants to build mobile apps. During the course, students were able to build many small projects with the purpose that at the end they would have a portfolio of applications to showcase during graduation. The student decided to build apps based on what they liked and social impact. During the course, students ran the apps using their Android devices and the virtual emulator provided by MIT App Inventor. For graduation, I found a few Android devices to allow all the students to run on a mobile app to make it more realistic. 

## NEXT STEP FOR US 

In the summer of 2021, we are bringing back the course with many new updates.
1. An intense week-long - The class will only be for a week (Monday to Friday).
2. There will be two levels, an entry-level and an intermediate level.
3. Heavy focus on design by bringing design partners.
4. A focus on building an impactful app.
The curriculum is ready and you can view the entry-level [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BrYluksnvNvTbW9AkyLI07HXCejKaJ8vwne7fL-tsc8/edit?usp=sharing) and the intermediate [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfWX4EBZBaXth8enV6Z8LQNiIv0PGNOafoGLv7osYn8/edit?usp=sharing).
